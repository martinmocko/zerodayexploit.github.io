<div class="blurb">
	<p class="text">
		My CV is probably going to be rather unusual. I don't really have much job experience aside from one short while part-time working for a company selling antiviruses, managing and updating their content in a CMS system and some other part-time jobs that don't have anything to do with IT.
		My educational achievements so far are these:
	<ul>
	<li>
		(2007-2012) Successfully graduated from Evangelical Lyceum in Bratislava
	</li>
	<li>
		(2012-) Studying at Faculty of Informatics and Information Technology, Slovak University of Technology. Bachelor program - Informatics. I hope to graduate this year and who knows what's next
	</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Projects</h3>
	<p class="text-small">
		I would like to mention some projects I've worked on (mainly for school) that I found interesting and challenging.
	</p>
	<ul class="cv">
	<li>
	My bachelor thesis: Discovering the trending topics in a continuous stream of data
	<p class="text-small" style="margin-left: 10px;"> My bachelor thesis is led by a doctorand on FIIT, Ing. Jakub Sevcech. We research the top-k items problem and also the connected problem of estimating the trending topics from a data stream. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	Parallel programming: Using OpenMP/MPI for parallel computing of convolution filters
	<p class="text-small" style="margin-left: 10px;"> This was a really cool school project where I learned a lot about parallel computing and how code can be easily parallelizable if there is an obvious way of how to divide tasks into parts for many computers to compute. </p>
	</li> 
	<li>
	Artificial intelligence: Using genetic algorithms to find a path in a 2D map that will find all treasures
	<p class="text-small" style="margin-left: 10px;"> A very challenging project which I really liked because there is no right answer or right algorithm that would be ideal for every kind of task. There is a big area for customization and trying different algorithms. </p>
	</li>
	</ul>

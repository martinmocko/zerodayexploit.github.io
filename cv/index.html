<div class="blurb">
	<p class="text">
		My CV is probably going to be rather unusual. I don't really have much job experience aside from one short while part-time working for a company selling antiviruses, managing and updating their content in a CMS system and some other part-time jobs that don't have anything to do with IT.
		My educational achievements so far are these:
	<ul>
	<li>
		(2007-2012) Successfully graduated from Evangelical Lyceum in Bratislava
	</li>
	<li>
		(2012-) Studying at Faculty of Informatics and Information Technology, Slovak University of Technology. Bachelor program - Informatics. I hope to graduate this year and who knows what's next
	</li>
	</ul>

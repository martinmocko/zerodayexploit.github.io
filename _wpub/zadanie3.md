In this assignment we worked with a source XML document that we used to transform to HTML pages and to PDF output. The source XML was a document for a presentation, in which we had to create a sample real presentation of some topic. Next, we used the necessary transformations to accomplish our goal. 
Asssignment 3 - XML presentation:
Analyse the means of writing a simple presentation in the language of XML. Identify the basic components of a presentation and design the XML elements for their tagging (metadata, structural, inline). Think about reusability and be aware of redundancy in code. The design of elements should be realized by describing the document using a selected language (DTD, XSD, RELAX NG) together with a description of the purpose of the elments. Create a sample presentation in your proposed language, which will demonstrate the possibilities of creating presentations according to the document type definition. 

Design and create XSLT stylesheets for the conversion of presentation from XML to XHTML+CSS and the conversion of presentation from XML to PDF. Make sure to think about reusability of the stylesheets for various output formats. Permit entering of parameters of transformations.

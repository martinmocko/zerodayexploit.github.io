This assignment had us work with [DocBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook) - a semantic markup laguage (originally intended) for technical documentation of hardware or software. However it can be used for any form of documentation. DocBook enables its users to create one source of the document - written in XML, and then to use XSL transformations to generate the desired output document - for example an HTML page, or a PDF document. We were tasked to generate the latter.  
Our PDF documents should satisfy these requirements:
<ul>
	<li>standard structuring of text into chapters, sections, subsections, subsubsections, appendices, generated content</li>
	<li>text highlighting, highlighting of the breakdown of text by bullet points or numbering </li>
	<li>links to other parts of the same document, possibly links to URLs </li>
	<li>footnotes</li>
	<li>bibliography and citation of sources in the text</li>
	<li>insertion of figures and tables, referencing them in the text; list of figures and list of tables at the beggining or the end of the work</li>
	<li>creation of an index with with the index terms hierarchically ordered into at least two levels, for example „cycles, while“, „cycles, for“ (at least show it as a demonstration on 10-15 terms to show how to work with the index)</li>
</ul>
The basic fundamental elements that we (and I) were using were tags like:
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
title
emphasis
figure
mediaobject
xref
para
literallayout
inlineequation
itemizedlist & orderedlist
index
indexterm,primary,secondary,tertiary
table
footnote
appendix
variablelist
bibliography, bibliomixed
{% endhighlight %}

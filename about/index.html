	<p>Below you will find some basic and also specific information about me, my interests and hobbies.</p>

	<p class="text">
	My name is Martin Mocko. I'm from Slovakia, which is located at the heart of Europe. I'm currently 23 years old. I've been living in Bratislava for all my life.
	</p>

	<p class="text">Currently I'm doing my bachelor degree at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies. We belong under the Slovak University of Technology.

	<h3>Interests</h3>
	<p class="text">
		I  generally like to do things effectively and with the least effort possible, so that also transpires into some of my interests. I also like to research topics that have some amount of depth to them. 
		<ul>
		<li>
		<em>Python.</em> I am currently very interested in Python. I sometimes work with Python when I need something done for my bachelor thesis, for example making good looking graphs. I feel like it offers the easy implementability I need, so that's why I'm planning to learn much more about this language. I'm also going to attend the PyCon conference which is going to take place at our faculty from 11. to 13. of March (2016 of course). I plan to write about it when I get the time !</li>
		<li>
		<em>Big Data.</em> I'm also interested in Big Data, data mining and also data analysis. It's partly because I get to work with some of the algorithms when I work on my bachelor thesis, but also because I'm kind of naturally drawn to working with numbers and playing around with them. I'm considering learning Apache Spark as my next move towards learning to work with Big Data, as well as trying out more data streaming algorithms.
		</li>
		<li>
		<em>Algorithms. </em>I generally like to play around with and read about algorithms, how they work and test them out. I find learning about them to be similar to the logical puzzles that sometimes people do just for fun, to train or test their thinking. I also find useful that it sometimes forces me to step out of my comfort zone. 
		</li>
		<li>
		<em>Space. </em> I don't know much about physics and I'm certainly no expert on physical theories, but I like to learn the facts and the theories about the space. I like to watch cool explanatory videos that cover topics about it, for example about the latest discovery of Gravitational Waves. If you're interested in it too, I can recommend channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Space Time</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CloserToTruth1">Closer To Truth</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/scishow">SciShow</a>.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<em>Counter Strike. </em>I love playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive and my current rank is LEM. I like that in order to be good, you need to have good versatility, you need to know how to adapt mid-round and you also need to develop gamesense. It has a lot of nuances that I find great in a game and the overall union of all these things is what keeps me excited for this game. I also like to watch pro games. If you want you can add me on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/pimpMEISTER/">steam</a> and we can play :)
	</li>
	<li>
	<em>Guitar.</em> A lot of people don't know this but when I was younger and until the second year of my studies at the faculty, I played the classic guitar. I took lessons at the Elementary Art School of Ludovit Rajter. I stopped so that I can devote more time for my studies at the faculty but I'm still passionate about it and I'm planning to come back to it sooner or later!
	</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Things I like</h3>
	<p class="text">
	I decided I'm going to include a section where I just name some things I like so here it goes :) <br />
	I like good food (preferably with meat in it), music, the Walking Dead, the Batman, interesting people, collaborating with others
